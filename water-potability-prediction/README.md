# Water Quality Prediction

This project is part of the *Fundamentals of Data Science* course in my college, where we explore and apply data science techniques to real-world datasets. In this project, we aims to predict the potability of water whether water is safe for human consumption based on various physical and chemical attributes using a machine learning model. This website is designed to help researchers to assess water potability based on various water quality parameters. In this project, we use the [Water Potability dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability?resource=download) from Kaggle.

## Model and Approach

We used the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to build a machine learning model for predicting water potability. The model is trained and evaluated using the dataset's various attributes to ensure accuracy and performance.

## How to Run the Website

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/water-potability-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd water-potability-prediction
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
